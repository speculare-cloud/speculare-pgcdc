Speculare PGCDC allows you to listen to changes in your PostgreSQL database via logical replication and then broadcast those changes over websockets.

`Realtime` server works by:
1. listening to PostgreSQL's logical replication (here using Wal2Json).
2. filtering the incoming message
3. broadcasting the message over websocket

Explaination
--------------------------

You probably know that Postgresql is not a realtime databse. So if we want to stream the change of it to a websocket or any UI it's not possible by default.

Hopefully Postgresql have that sweet feature named `Logical Replication`, which stream the change made into the database over a replication slot. We can use a multitude of plugins to format the output of this stream, but for Speculare-PGCDC we've chosen to use wal2json.

This project create a replication slot on the targeted postgres instance and then stream the change from this slot to all the websockets connected.

Project Status
--------------------------

This project is still under development and the documentation is constantly changing. 
You are welcome to try it, but expect some changes with future updates. 
TAGs are used to mark a certain version in all Speculare repositories as compatible with each others.

Server setup / Dev setup
--------------------------

- Install all deps
```bash
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libpq-dev pkg-config build-essential
```

- Create a pgcdc.config file based on pgcdc.example.config

> **âš  WARNING: Check the [docs](https://docs.speculare.cloud) !**

Usage
--------------------------

```
$ wss://server/ws?query=change_type:table:col.eq.val
```
will get `change_type` event from `table` where `col` is `equals` to `val`.

The `change_type` and `table` parameters are mandatory, if you're missing them you'll get a 400 error.
`change_type` can be any of those: *, insert, update, delete.
`table` must be a valid table of your database.

I decided to restrict the API in such way that a single websocket can only listen to one table. 
This might change in the future if needed, but as of now and in the current shape of Speculare, it's not needed.
