Speculare PGCDC is intended to stream the change from the Posgtresql database using CDC.

This project is meant to evolve in something more complete and more complexe in a somewhat near future.


Explaination
--------------------------

As you probably know, Postgresql is not a realtime databse. So if we want to stream the change of it to a websocket or any UI it's not possible by default.

Hopefully Postgresql have that sweet feature named `Logical Replication`, which stream the change made into the database over a replication slot. We can use a multitude of plugin to format the output of this stream, but for Speculare-PGCDC I've chosen to use wal2json.

This project "simply" create a replication slot on the targeted postgres instance (if it's supported) and then stream the change from this slot to all the websockets connected. It offer you some benefit such as only getting change from one table, or for one type of event `INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE` or even by filtering results like you would do with a `WHERE` clause in SQL (simpler, only one WHERE clause).

Server setup / Dev setup
--------------------------

- Install all deps
```bash
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libpq-dev pkg-config build-essential
```

There pretty much only one step in this setup (other than Docker (see below) and is optional)

- Create a Pgcdc.toml file based on Example.toml

Usage
--------------------------

```
$ curl /ws?query=change_type:table:col.eq.val
```
_will get change_type event from table where col is equals to val

The `change_table` and `table` parameters are mandatory, if you're missing them you'll get a 400 error.
Change_table can be either of those: *, insert, update, delete.
Table must be a valid table of your database.

I decided to restrict the API in such way that a single websocket can only listen to one table. This might change in the future if needed, but as of now and in the current shape of Speculare, it's not needed.
